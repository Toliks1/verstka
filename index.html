				<p>If you're looking to burn some serious fat and you're not afraid of a little intensity,
					you've come to the right program. Super Shredded B ("SSB" for short) is an 8-week

					sum up what Super Shredded 8 is, i would say it's a combination of my Show Time.

					My Super-Man program uses supersets in which exercises for opposing muscle

					Joe Weider over 50 years ago. But nowadays, the lifting community basically calls
					any pairing of two exercises with no rest in between a superset, so i'll stick with the
